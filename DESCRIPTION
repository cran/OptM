Description: The popular population genetic software 'Treemix' by
    'Pickrell and Pritchard' (2002) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1002967>
    estimates the number of migration edges on a population tree.
    However, it can be difficult to determine the number of migration
    edges to include. Previously, it was customary to stop adding migration
    edges when 99.8% of variation in the data was explained, but 'OptM'
    automates this process using an ad hoc statistic based on the
    second-order rate of change in the log likelihood.  'OptM' also
    has added functionality for various threshold modeling
    to compare with the ad hoc statistic.
